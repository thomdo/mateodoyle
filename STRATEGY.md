# Mateo’s Garage
Stategic foundation

## North Star

The ultimate goal is to make Mateo smile, laugh, and feel a sense of wonder. Every decision must serve the purpose of his happiness and entertainment.

## Vision

A project that becomes a core childhood memory—something tangible he can look back on as an adult and say, "My dad made this for me, and it was magic." It stands the test of time as a symbol of love and fun.

## Mission

To build a digital toy box where Mateo’s imagination is the engine. We prioritize 'fun' over 'features' and 'play' over 'perfection.

## Principles

The project will be guided by the following principles to shape the experience.

### 1 of 1

This isn’t an app for "users"—it is a custom build for Mateo. We don’t build generic features; we build specific magic. If he wants a button that turns the screen purple, he gets it. No scalability, no mass appeal—just a bespoke experience that is his and his alone.

### Engineered for joy.

Performance isn't measured in efficiency; it is measured in delight. We prioritize visceral reactions over standard utility. If a feature serves no logical purpose other than to induce a smile, it is prioritized. The interface itself must be as fun to play with as the data inside it.

### Continuous tuning.

This is not a static product; it is a project car. We avoid rigid structures in favor of a modular chassis that supports constant 'tuning.' The experience matures alongside the driver, evolving from simple play to complex mastery without ever losing its soul.

### Effortless handling.

Interaction must be intuitive. No complex menus or loading screens that kill the momentum of play. The controls should feel invisible, removing any barrier between Mateo and his imagination.

## The Hero

## Success metrics

* **The Giggle Test:** Does Mateo smile, laugh, or gasp within the first 60 seconds of opening the garage?  
* **The "Look at This!" Factor:** How often does he run over to show you (or Mom) something cool that just happened on the screen?  
* **Imaginative sprawl:** Does the digital experience spill over into the real world, sparking vroom noises or backstories for his physical cars?  
* **Builder’s high**: Are you having fun building it? (If it feels like a chore, the soul is gone.)
