# Mateo's Garage 🏎️💨

Welcome to **Mateo's Garage** – a bespoke digital toy box built specifically for my son to showcase and interact with his Hot Wheels collection.

This project is not just a website; it's a "1 of 1" experience designed to spark joy, laughter, and imagination.

## 🛠️ How It Works

This is a custom-built **Static Site Generator (SSG)** tailored for this project. It takes a JSON database of cars and generates a complete, interconnected website. The build script (`build.js`) uses only standard Node.js modules (`fs`, `path`).

## 📂 Project Structure

-   **`build.js`**: The core build script that generates the site.
-   **`cars.json`**: The database containing car details (ID, name, color, image path).
-   **`templates/`**: HTML templates for the index and detail pages.
-   **`assets/`**: Images and other static media.
-   **`css/`**: Stylesheets for the project.
-   **`dist/`**: The output directory for the generated site (git-ignored).
-   **`STRATEGY.md`**: The guiding principles and vision for the project.

## 🏎️ Design Principles

1.  **1 of 1**: A bespoke experience for Mateo.
2.  **Engineered for Joy**: Delight over efficiency.
3.  **Continuous Tuning**: A project car that evolves with its driver.
4.  **Effortless Handling**: Intuitive controls for little hands.
